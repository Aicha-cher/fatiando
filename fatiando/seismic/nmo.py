def nmo_correction(cmp, dt, offsets, velocities):
    """
    Performs NMO correction on the given CMP.

    The units must be consistent. E.g., if dt is seconds and
    offsets is meters, velocities must be m/s.

    Uses the method described in Yilmaz (2001).

    Parameters:

    cmp : 2D array
        The CMP gather that we want to correct.
    dt : float
        The sampling interval.
    offsets : 1D array
        An array with the offset of each trace in the CMP.
    velocities : 1D array
        An array with the NMO velocity for each time. Should
        have the same number of elements as the CMP has samples.

    Returns:

    nmo : 2D array
        The NMO corrected gather.
