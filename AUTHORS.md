# Project Contributors

## History

This project was started in 2010 by [Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)
during his Masters degree at the Observatório Nacional, Brazil,
after long discussions with Vanderlei C. Oliveira Junior.
It was an ambitious project to implement different methods from all geophysics
disciplines, something only a young and naive grad student would try to
undertake.

The project eventually took the form of a Python library and has been in
continued development.
It is heavily used for research in the [PINGA lab](http://www.pinga-lab.org/)
and by other scientists around the world
([Google Scholar citations](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=176955436333143762&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en)).
